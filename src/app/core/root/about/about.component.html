        <p>I am a Brazilian graduated Computer Engineer. I love <a href="https://github.com/marcosvrs/" (click)="onClick('Github')" target="_blank">coding</a>,
          playing guitar and Brazil. I also LOVE coffee. I knew my vocation since I was 14 years old.</p>
        <p>At my time at the <a href="http://unisanta.br/" (click)="onClick('Unisanta')" target="_blank">University</a>, I collaborated in an international
          project called
          <a href="http://butterflysrl.com/" (click)="onClick('Butterfly')" target="_blank">Butterfly</a> that became my Term paper at the end of the course.
        </p>
        <p>After 5 years working at <a href="http://www.rodrimar.com.br/" (click)="onClick('Rodrimar')" target="_blank">Rodrimar</a>, I had 3 different positions:
          IT-Internship, Technical Support Analyst and System Analyst. During my time in there I was able to gaining a wide
          knowledge that I consider decisive.</p>
        <p>At this moment, I'm based in Hamburg learning German and studying to stay up to date with the latest programming
          languages and trying to increment my working experience in another country.</p>
