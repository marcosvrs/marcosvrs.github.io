                <p>I am a Brazilian graduated Computer Engineer. I love <a href="https://github.com/marcosvrs/" target="_blank">coding</a>,
                    playing guitar and Germany. I also LOVE coffee. I knew my vocation since I was 14 years old.</p>
                <p>At my time at the <a href="http://unisanta.br/" target="_blank">University</a>, I collaborated in a international
                    project called
                    <a href="http://butterflysrl.com/" target="_blank">Butterfly</a> that became my Term paper at the end
                    of the course.</p>
                <p>After 5 years working at <a href="http://www.rodrimar.com.br/" target="_blank">Rodrimar</a>, I had 3 differents
                    positions: IT-Internship, Technical Support Analyst and System Analyst. During my time at there I was
                    able to gaining wide knowledge that I consider decisive.</p>
                <p>At this moment, I'm based at Hamburg learning German and studing to stay up to date with the lastest programing
                    language and trying to increment my working experience in another country.</p>
